# Diana's Outreachy Blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garbados/outreachy-blog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garbados/outreachy-blog)

A static blog, made using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and the theme [Weightless](https://git.fm/zllovesuki/hexo-theme-weightless).

I try to keep the content [Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/)-specific.

## Writing

Posts are under `source/_posts`. You can generate a new one with by running `hexo new post "[title]"`. Use `hexo serve` to generate a development version of the site, which you can access (by default) at `localhost:4000`.

## Publishing

Make changes and push to master. Travis will deploy your updates to GitHub Pages, which serves the site.

## License

See `license.md`.
