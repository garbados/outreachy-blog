Hello! My name is Diana.

I've been asked to develop a blog to discuss my activities and experiences during my internship with Yocto through the Outreachy program. This is that blog.

Maintaining public artifacts like this can be nerve-wracking. Visibility means the peering of strangers, and strangers go sour easy. I don't want to talk about those sour-goings in my life. If you've also been harassed, stalked, hurt, abused, or traumatized, you are not alone. I'm here. You're here. We're here together.

I believe in you. Thank you for believing in me.

Wish me luck through this, ok? ðŸ’–
