Hello! My name is Diana.

I've been asked to develop a blog to discuss my activities and experiences during my internship with Yocto through the Outreachy program. This is that blog.

I'm excited about the program, but visibility makes me very nervous! So, this blog will focus on the tech that I use and work with over the next few months.

The blog itself is built with [Hexo][hexo] and uses a [fork][cactus-dark-fork] of the [cactus-dark][cactus-dark] theme. I host it through GitHub Pages [here][www]. I like Hexo because I'm comfortable with JavaScript, and I publish through GitHub because it's free. You can check out the blog's source code [here][src].

I believe in you. Wish me luck through this, ok? ðŸ’–
